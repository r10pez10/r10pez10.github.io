    A woman in a Suzuki Jimny was getting tailgated/bullied by a trade ute because she was doing the speed limit. The tradies changed lanes and sped off, but when we caught up to each other at the lights I made sure to point at her and give her a thumbs up for being correct.

    Alfred's Kitchen was busy because there was a whole meetup of Volkswagen Kombis and Beetles in the carpark.
