    Drove all the way down to Safety Bay to pick up a china cymbal. 40 AUD was a pretty good deal! Though it was a 3+ hour round trip.

    A woman in a Suzuki Jimny was getting tailgated/bullied by a trade ute because she was doing the speed limit. The tradies changed lanes and sped off, but when we caught up to each other at the lights I made sure to point at her and give her a thumbs up for being correct.
    <br>
    I looked at a roadworker funny because they had bunny ears on top of their hard hat. (They caught me looking at them funny.)
    <br>
    Alfred's Kitchen was busy because there was a whole meetup of Volkswagen Kombis and Beetles in the carpark.
    <br>
    Everything happens on Wednesdays, eh?

    Spent most of this weekend singing Beyonce for teach tracks for choir.

    Thinking about the people who I used to deliver to - Tihana from Mary St Bakery wished me "Have a good life" on my last day; Piper from Kirkwood Deli said "she'd miss our little chats."

    Met a second Draegana today, who was running security (guarding the entrance to backstage) at the Pride Fair today. The first one was someone who worked at one of the cafes in Garden City Booragoon. Might have been the same one. (Draegana means 'star' in Polish ?)<br>
    The Perth Pride Choir were singing on stage, which seems like it went pretty well. Our final performances for this year are coming up.

    We saw Simone Craddock at the Ellington last night. I mean, I say "we" but it was just me who headed out there.
    Got there a bit early so headed across the street to the Leadlight for a drink and some food. The spicy chicken tenders were spicy, so I went for ice-cream after.
    <br>
    Getting in early and by myself is sort of a habit, so I ended up early and by myself inside. Waved to the waitress who I see there sometimes. She smiled on her way across, stopped and then came back.
    <br>
    She knew my name.
    <br>
    "Ronald."<br>
    "Darleigh."<br>
    Actually, is that how it's spelled? I hadn't really heard a name like that before, so I guessed either D-a-r-l-e-e or D-a-r-l-e-i-g-h.<br>Wrong. Dahli.<br>
    "You know the artist, Salvador Dali? It's based off of that."<br>
    "Well, my dad named me after Ronald Reagan."<br>
    She pulled such a wild expression.<br>
    "At least you can say it's a good story."<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      The person who sat at the table with me introduced herself as Shelley ? (I didn't ask for spelling clarification!) Possibly one of the most interesting people I have met. Fly-in fly-out health and safety officer for a minesite in the Northern Territory who had been spending the past eighteen months in her off-swings travelling around south-east Asia, who also went to the Ellington alone, has been living out of a duffle bag, does free-diving and is working on getting a motorcycle and her motorcycle licence, who grew up in a farm over east. She was in the hospitality industry for fifteen years running events and being sent to bartending championships before the pandemic threw a wrench it what seemed to be an untouchable industry, so she changed careers.<br>
      Just really fascinating and easy to talk to. Says she cares about and is interested in people, which I guess is a common factor between the two disciplines.

      Resentment is such a useless emotion(?)<br>
      I'm finding that I'm resenting people more and more. For being successful(?) or skillful(?) or richer(?) or just feeling like they are better off than me, mentally or more financially secure, able to do what they want to do in life,<p>
      So I'm trying to cognitive-behavioural-therapy my way out of it, or at least to somewhere healthier, where it doesn't lead to despair.<br>
      And I guess typing this blog log text thing is part of that.<br>
      Though I do wonder why I'm typing it online.<br>
      But also no one is going to see this.<br>
